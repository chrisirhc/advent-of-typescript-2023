My solutions to https://typehero.dev/aot-2023 . 

## Plans
- [ ] Study other solutions and see if I can improve mine and review gaps, note differences.

## Solutions to study:
### https://github.com/TkDodo/aot-2023
- 03: Uses `TSomething` for longer readable generic type variable names. 
- 05: Used `ReadonlyArray`
- 12: TkDodo's algorithm is simpler.
- 13: Indeed my method was brute-force. I used a combination of addition and recursion to get a full list. I guess the method I thought of was similar to what others came up with. The use of Acc[number] is simpler, and the use of `Exclude` is cleaner. The use of recursion is restricted to only the `Fill`, which is simpler and easier to read.
